Part 2: Readme

Decision Tree algorithim

This program implements a simple ID3 Decision Tree algorithim.
It takes a csv file as input and generates a decision tree based on the predictions.
The output includes the accuracy of the algorithim and print's a tree to a txt file 

Prerequesits
- python3
- numpy
- pandas
- CSV training data is found in the /part2 directory 

Usage
1. Navigate to the part2 folder containing DT.py
2. Run the program using the following command 
    python3 DT.py <train_data.csv> <output>
3. Replace train_data.csv with rtg_A.csv and output as your preferred output file 
4. Once the program has been run, the Accuracy will be printed to the terminal 
    and the ouput file will be saved to /part2
